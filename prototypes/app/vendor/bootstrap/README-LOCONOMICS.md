# Bootstrap custom download

The contents of this directory are from the Bootstrap Customizer and a few
additions to work with the code.

The /config2less-vars.js allows to create a Less file from the 
downloaded config.json with the variables, suitable for custom compilations
using the rest of the Bootstrap source code or plug-ins.

**The complete source code for Bootstrap is not included here right now**.
Just build files and some sources generated/manipulated (the /less and /styl folders).
