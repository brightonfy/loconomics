/**
    Variables from the styleguide, in Stylus format.

    IMPORTANT: Bootstrap variables converted from Less are imported,
    and following are a set of incomplete manual list used previously as copied manual values
    now getting value from the Bootstrap original variable, better names and additions here.

    DESCRIPTION: Here a set of Styleguide specific variables are defined, with some values
    coming from Bootstrap variables and new ones.
    There are variables that are just aliases of Bootstrap and extra added variables
    required to implement the Styleguide design additionally to the Bootstrap base.
