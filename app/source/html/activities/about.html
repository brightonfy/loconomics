                    <h1>About us</h1>    
                    <p>Launching in beta this fall, Loconomics is an on-demand marketplace for clients to book local services (housecleaning, tutoring, massage therapy, etc.) and gives service professionals the tools and technology needed to run their own business. While virtually all “sharing” economy platforms are currently owned by venture capitalists, Loconomics is structured as a freelancer and employee-owned cooperative with innovative bylaws written by Janelle Orsi (Sustainable Economies Law Center). Service professionals elect the board and pay a monthly user fee to fund the business team that oversees the marketing and operations of the platform. Any profits left over are either reinvested or distributed to owners based on the number of hours booked through the platform.</p>
                    <h2>Mission</h2>
                    <p>Our mission is to use technology, shared ownership, and community to grow local economies. We provide our owners, local service professionals, the tools, marketplace, and community that empower them to thrive in their work. We provide their clients an on-demand marketplace where they can discover and directly book local service professionals safely, and easily without middle-men.</p>
                    <h2>Cooperative Model</h2>
                    <p>Loconomics chose to form as a cooperative in order to steward its tools, platform, services, resources, community, and opportunities as a commons. As writer David Bollier describes, “A commons may arise whenever a group of people decides that it wishes to manage a resource in a collective manner, with a special regard for equitable access [...] and long-term stewardship.” Loconomics is substantially shielded from the lust for wealth accumulation and short-term gain, thereby allowing it to focus on activities that grow and spread benefit among the Owners and communities.</p>
                    <p>A cooperative structure generally demands that every owner have an equal vote in the election of the board and in other major decisions. A cooperative structure also generally demands that the profits of the enterprise be returned to the owners in proportion to each owners’ participation in generating value for the company. Loconomics believes that its mission will be most effectively advanced by this combination of factors, which distinguish a cooperative from a conventional for-profit corporation.</p>
