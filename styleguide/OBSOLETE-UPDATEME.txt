The styleguide content is obsolete right now, after started the following iterations to create the mobile App and new website UI this was used as a base but changed a lot and the results are keep in the /app subproject. 

Its required to update current assets with developed code at /app, and reuse the Grunt tasks there to automate the generation of assets.
Its required to manually update the documentation and examples on the html files.

Current asset bundles were generated on the /web tasks and some on the /app tasks, but needs normalization through the code and tasks at /app.

This pages require some note about what version of the assets are documenting, to compare status with current developed and deployed work.

DELETE THIS FILE WHEN THE STYLEGUIDE IS PROPERLY UPDATED AND MAINTAINED.
