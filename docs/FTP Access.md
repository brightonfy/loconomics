# FTP Access
You should only need access to the FTP if you're doing backend work that needs to be uploaded to a loconomics.com channel. May happen that a developer works on a non-Windows machine (Mac, Linux) so cannot test the changes locally and needs access to the *dev.loconomics.com* FTP to try changes. Otherwise, all testing can be done from your local machine.

And, of course, anyone that is in charge to *release* a new version.
