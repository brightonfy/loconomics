## CSS Naming Conventions

We use Bootstrap as CSS framework and it has it's own naming rules, for anything related to Boostrap (like adding changes, modifiers on top of Bootstrap classes) or files under /utils folder, we follow the simple Boostrap naming.

But for *components* styles, the classes at /components folder that start with uppercase letter, we use [SUIT naming convention](https://github.com/suitcss/suit/blob/master/doc/naming-conventions.md)

**Disclaimer**: this rules were not strictly followed in the past or there is code created before we set this rules, then current source code needs some clean-up/refator. New code must follow the rules.
