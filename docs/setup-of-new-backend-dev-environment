1. Create a backup of current dev database
2. Create a database using the dev backup named devYOURNAME 
3. Copy the dev folder to your local machine to make these changes:
  - Rename the folder devYOURNAME
  - Make the following changes to the devYOURNAME/web.config file:
    - <add key="Channel" value="devYOURNAME" />
    - change any reference of 31755_dev to 31755_devYOURNAME (all passwords remain the same)
4. Copy the loconomi/web.config file to your local machine to make these changes:
  - Make a copy of original and name it web.last2.config (so you still have web.last.config)
  - Add 
            <add input="{HTTP_HOST}" pattern="^(www\.)?devYOURNAME\.loconomics\.com$" negate="true" />
  - Copy the  <!-- dev --> section and change any "dev" to "devYOURNAME"
5. Put the new loconomi/web.config and web.last2.config into loconomi and test the dev and live sites to ensure they continue to work
6. Put the devYOURNAME folder (with new web.config file) into loconomi
7. Register the asp.net virtual app, by going to the Winhost control panel, [Application Starting Point] (https://cp.winhost.com/sites/application.aspx), and create it just selecting the folder.
