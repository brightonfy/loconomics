    /* Someone: Where is my code? 
       Iago: the old code was 'refactored':
        - the main code lines in the file beggining is organizated in different
        functions in the file ~/App_Code/ProfileFunctions.cshtml,
        - and most of html code was splited between different files under Profile folder
        - Some old code was maintained commented inside the differents files 
        (each commented code where more properly must be).
        - Some old 'sub-pages' used still exists 'un-touched' (for example, MailBoxGrid.cshtml is
        not used now but exists, and others)
       NOTE: Delete this comment when you are done ;-)
