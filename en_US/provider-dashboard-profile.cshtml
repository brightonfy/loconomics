       Iago: the old code was 'refactored':
        - the main code lines in the file beggining is organizated in different
        functions in the file ~/App_Code/DashboardFunctions.cshtml,
        - and most of html code was splited between different files under Dashboard folder
       NOTE: Delete this comment when you are done ;-)
